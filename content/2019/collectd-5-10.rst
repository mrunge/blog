We are pleased to announce that collectd-5.10.

For the release notes, please see the `separate email`_ to the official
collectd email list.

This is also intended to announce the upcoming changes and the future
plans.

Back in Feburary, we had an in-person meeting in Brussels, just before
FOSDEM. Back then, we decided to get back to having three releases per
year.

There has been some disappointment with current maintainers, since the
ability of "simple" or "quick" patches was removed. We are going to
introduce the possibility again. The reason behind this is, that we want
code reviews in general. If there is a bugfix, which was already reviewed
and approved in a different branch, that would have to go through an
additiona√∂ review to merge it e.g in master branch. There will be
a switch to create an exception for this use case.

Florian Forster kindly hosted the `collectd home page`_, the wiki and (?) on his
private server. This is a maintenance burden for him, he should not
be required to take. We are moving the wiki and other hosted services
to a different infrastructure. Florian will still be around and will still
be a key person for collectd and the community. He just lead us the path
and then got out of the way.

Another outlook is, that we are going to have another in-person meetup.
The place and time is to be decided. An option is certainly to meet
again just before FOSDEM. If you're interested in participating, please
contact me directly.
