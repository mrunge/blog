Sadly, I won't make it to the new Fedora users and developers conference
Flock this time. Back in may, I proposed an `OpenStack testing
session`_.

The more I'm delighted, that we have `Kashyap Chamarthy`_, who will
leading the session. He also added some news around the event to his
`blog`_

This makes me sad another time, because I can not attend his session, so
if you're there, you should give OpenStack a try!
