As you might heard, we at Fedora had FUDCons (Fedora Users and
Developers conference), which is now replaced by a conference named
`Flock`_. The first one will be held in Charleston, South Carolina
between Aug. 9th and 12th. 2013. Coming there is a unique chance this
year, to meet many Fedora users and developers to come together, discuss
new ideas, work to make those ideas a reality, and continue to promote
the core values of the Fedora Community: Freedom, Friends, Features, and
First.

OpenStack is a somehow complex thing to setup and to integrate into
Linux distributions. Thus, I proposed an `OpenStack testing hackfest at
Flock`_, to test the latest build for Fedora, and also to bring users
and developers together into one room. Currently, it is not decided, if
this session is accepted, so please stay tuned.
